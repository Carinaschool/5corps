# 5corps
 We at 5 corporate are trying to make a one-stop website for users to look for hotels, activities and places to play when visiting a city or a country.

 # What differentiate us from other booking websites or trip advisors
   1 We provide a point collection system that allows user to collect tokens when they book anything from our website. This allows them to exchage vouchers for their next trip.
   
   2 Users can view reviews from experts that provides quality reviews about the attractions, because experts can use their personal experience to comment on that trip itself.

   3 Users do not need to browse through different website when finding a travel plans to execute, for example Tiktok or Facebook

   4 Users can find out what is near them for examples popular cafes and places to visit if they have no idea on what to do at that specific place
   


 ### Deployments
This is an example of a successful transaction if a user successfully uses thier tokens to exchange for a voucher.
